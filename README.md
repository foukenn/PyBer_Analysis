# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
 - Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.
 + Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.
 * Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis.

### Deliverable 3

### Recommendations
- Charge passengers more per mile in urban cities because the rides are most likely shorter, causing the urban drivers not to earn as much per trip compared to the other 2 city types.
- Also within urban cities is that the number of drivers is greater than the total amount of rides, and lowering the driver count would boost the fare amount made by each driver.
- Reversely, within suburban cities the number of rides is higher than drivers, and increasing the number of drivers might increase the number of rides and the number of fares earned.
